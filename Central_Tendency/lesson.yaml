  Output: "Today, I'll be teaching you the basics of data analysis. It probably makes
    sense to start by defining the word DATA."

- Class: text
  Output: 'According to Wikipedia, "Data are values of qualitative or quantitative
    variables, belonging to a set of items."'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Often the "set of items" that we are interested in studying is referred
    to as the POPULATION. Data analysis usually involves studying a subset, or SAMPLE,
    of an entire population.'

- Class: figure
  Output: Here is a diagram showing the relationship between a population and a sample.
  Figure: mod1_pop_vs_samp.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: 'Data analysis should always start with a specific question of interest.
    For example, we might ask "What percentage of people living in the United States
    are over six feet tall?"'

- Class: text
  Output: "Here, our population of interest is everyone living in the US. Since it's
    impractical to measure the heights of over 300 million people, we could instead
    choose 100 people at random and measure their heights. Our hope would be that
    this sample of 100 people is REPRESENTATIVE of the entire US population."
