- Class: text
  Output: "Today, I'll be teaching you the basics of data analysis. It probably makes
    sense to start by defining the word DATA."

- Class: text
  Output: 'According to Wikipedia, "Data are values of qualitative or quantitative
    variables, belonging to a set of items."'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Often the "set of items" that we are interested in studying is referred
    to as the POPULATION. Data analysis usually involves studying a subset, or SAMPLE,
    of an entire population.'

- Class: figure
  Output: Here is a diagram showing the relationship between a population and a sample.
  Figure: mod1_pop_vs_samp.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: 'Data analysis should always start with a specific question of interest.
    For example, we might ask "What percentage of people living in the United States
    are over six feet tall?"'

- Class: text
  Output: "Here, our population of interest is everyone living in the US. Since it's
    impractical to measure the heights of over 300 million people, we could instead
    choose 100 people at random and measure their heights. Our hope would be that
    this sample of 100 people is REPRESENTATIVE of the entire US population."

- Class: text
  Output: "The purpose of analyzing a sample is to draw conclusions about the population
    from which the sample was selected. This is called INFERENCE and is the primary
    goal of INFERENTIAL STATISTICS."

- Class: text
  Output: "In order to make any inferences about the population, we first need to describe
    the sample. This is the primary goal of DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS."

- Class: text
  Output: "If we want to describe our sample using just one number, how would we best
    do it? A good start is to find the center, the middle, or the most common element
    of our data. Statisticians call this the CENTRAL TENDENCY."

- Class: text
  Output: "There are three different methods for finding such a number and the applicability
    of each method depends on the situation. Those three methods are called the MEAN,
    MEDIAN, and MODE."
