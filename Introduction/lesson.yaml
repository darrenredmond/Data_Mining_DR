  Output: "We have noticed that:
      whole milk appears in       2513 transactions (25.6%).
      other vegetables appears in 1903 transactions (19.3%).
      whole milk and other vegetables appear together in 736 transactions (7.5%).
    Do they appear together more or less than we might expect?"
  AnswerChoices: more; less; equal 
  CorrectAnswer: more 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='more')
  Hint: Together they appear in 736 transactions - i.e. 38.7% of other vegetable transactions but this is normally 19.3%.

- Class: text
  Output: "Normally other vegetables occur in 19.3% of transactions but when whole milk has already occurred it appears to occur more frequently."

  Output: "Which of the following is the Frechet upper bound?"
  AnswerChoices: P(A ∩ B) ≤ min{P(A), P(B)}; 0 ≤ P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(B); 0 ≤ P(A ∩ B) ≤ P(A)
  CorrectAnswer: P(A ∩ B) ≤ min{P(A), P(B)}
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(A ∩ B) ≤ min{P(A), P(B)}')

  Output: "Suppose that in a physiotherapy clinic patients have the following symptom probabilities: P{Back Pain} = 0.63. P{Leg Pain} = 0.43. What is the: maximum possible value for P{Back Pain, Leg Pain}? minimum possible value for P{Back Pain, Leg Pain}? the value of P{Back Pain, Leg Pain} if the symptoms are independent?"
  AnswerChoices: 0.43, 0, 0.27; 0.63, 0, 0.27; 0.43, 0, 0.43
  CorrectAnswer: 0.43, 0, 0.27
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.43, 0, 0.27')
